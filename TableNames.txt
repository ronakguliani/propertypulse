Table names and columns use in PropertPulse

This project uses the same naming conventions as the IWMS software that Portland State University Uses for their own maintenance ticketing system.
If implemented later, the table names and columns will be easier to port over to the actual database.

Definitions:
- Record: is just a row in a table
- Work Order: This is the submitted request from a user asking for facilities to perform maintenance or other tasks.
- Phase: A phase is a sub-record of a Work Order. these records split work requirements betweeen various trades and shops.
- Work Code: is a predefined category for the type of work that is going to be performed. (in the db it is called called craft_code)

ae_p_pro_e
This table holds the unique id of the proposed work or maintenance request and will contain
the description from the customer placing the request.

ae_p_pro_e
proposal        varchar(15)    primary key
description     varchar(255)
status_code     varchar(20)     
bldg            varchar(20)
order_type      varchar(15)
category        varchar(15) 
ent_date        datetime
edit_date       datetime

---

ae_p_sta_e
this table stores the status change transactions for a given work order. Generally, all work orders will start at status '11-OPEN' and are considered completed
when work orders are in status '70-WRKCOMP'. However, it is important to check if all phases are also '70-WRKCOMP'.

ae_p_sta_e
proposal        varchar(15)    primary key
status_code     varchar(15)    primary key
status_date     datetime       primary key

---

ae_p_phs_e
This table holds phases for work orders and in general shows the same information that is found on the work order. However, this table has additional
parameters that help specify what type of work is going to be done from a preset list.

ae_p_phs_e
proposal        varchar(15)    primary key
sort_code       varchar(15)    primary key
craft_code      varchar(25)    primary key

---

ae_p_pst_e
this table stores the status transactions for a work order's phases. Generally, phase statuses will start in '11-OPEN' and are considered completed
when the status changes to '70-WRKCOMP'.

ae_p_sta_e
proposal        varchar(15)    primary key
sort_code       varchar(15)    primary key
status_code     varchar(15)    primary key
status_date     datetime       primary key

ae_p_pro_s
This table stores shop employee assignments to a phase. These individuals are then responsible for working on the phase and managing the updates on the phase.
However, phase management can also be done by their shop managers.

ae_p_pro_s
proposal        varchar(15)    primary key
sort_code       varchar(15)    primary key
shop_person     varchar(15)    primary key

ae_s_bld_c
This table holds the building ids for every building on campus. they are referenced in the work order record.

ae_s_bld_c
bldg    varchar(15)     primary key

ae_s_bld_c_udf
This table references custom values for a given building id. It is separate because the actual implementation contains more values between each table.
However, for this project only columns that are important are being copied.

ae_s_bld_c_udf
bldg        varchar(15)     primary key
custom003   varchar(60)
custom007   varchar(60)
custom010   varchar(60)

explanation:
- custom003: This holds the building's acronym
- custom007: This holds the ID of the dedicated maintenance worker (if applicable)
- custom010: this holds who is responsible for the building maintenance 

Custom010
Operations = General Maintenace, 
PMC = Contracted Maintenance, 
ZONE and PARKING = Student-funded Maintenace,
HOUSING = Housing Maintenanc
N/A = General Maintenace (N/A are for spaces that are much broader in ownership. For example: The campus underground tunnels and loop)

ae_x_cft_e
is a table that has a list of the work codes that describe the type of work that will be performed on a phase.

ae_x_cft_e
craft_code  varchar(25)     primary key
description varchar(255)
order_type  varchar(15)     primary key
category    varchar(15)     primary key

ae_h_emp_e
this table is a list of current employees.

ae_h_emp_e
shop_person varchar(15)     primary key
fname       varchar(25)
lname       varchar(25)

ae_h_sch_d
this table holds the rows for an employees work day. each individual's schedule day is a sequence and varies based on their schedule.

if an employee works 5x8hr days they will have five entries, 4x10, four entries.

the day of the week starts on Sunday (1) and ends Saturday (7)

ae_h_sch_d
shop_person     varchar(25)     primary key
seq             numeric(5)      primary key
